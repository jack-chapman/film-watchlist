# Movie Watchlist
## Description
### What is the Movie Watchlist

The Movie Watchlist leverages the Open Movie Database API, enabling users to search for films they want to watch. Users can add films to a watchlist or remove them as needed, with all data saved to and removed from their local storage.

### Technologies Used

I have used JavaScript for this project, because: 
- Easy API handling through the use of 'fetch'
- localStorage allows to save the user's watchlist directly in their browser
- Enhances the user experience as the user will know when searching for a film whether its already in their watchlist.

### Implementations for future
- A loading wheel for when the user is waiting for search results.
- The ability to remove a movie from the watch list via the search results.
